# Weapon Attributes
The definitions for the columns in [[Melee Weapons\|Melee Weapons]] and [[Ranged Weapons\|Ranged Weapons]].

### Grip
Indicates if you need one or two weapons to wield a weapon. You can have only one two-handed weapon or two one-handed weapons (including a shield) drawn at the same time. The STR requirement for a one handed weapon decreases if you hold it with both hands.

### STR Requirement
STR is the minimum strength attribute a character can have to effectively wield a weapon. If your STR is les that the requirement, you get a bane on all attacks and parries with the weapon. If your STR is *less the half* the requirement, you cannot use the weapon at all.

### Damage
This indicates how much damage the weapon inflicts on a hit. Damage can be increased by [[Damage Bonus\|Damage Bonus]] and decreased by [[Armor and Helmets\|Armor and Helmets]].

### Durability
This is how much damage you can parry without damaging the weapon. Successfully [[Parrying\|Parrying]] an attack negates all damage and grants free movement.

### Range
