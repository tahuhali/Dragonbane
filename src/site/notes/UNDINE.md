The spell summons a water elemental. The undine looks
like a tidal wave whose crest is shaped like a woman composed
entirely of water. It counts as a monster in combat
(page 84), follows its creator’s commands (free action),
and can act independently with its own initiative, but must
stay within sight of the mage.
