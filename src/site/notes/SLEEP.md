The target of the spell must succeed with a WIL roll or fall
into a deep sleep for one stretch. NPCs roll against their
maximum WP if this is listed, reduced by 2 for each level
of the Focused heroic ability. If WP is not listed, NPCs roll
against 10. If the roll succeeds, the victim still gets **Dazed**.
The victim rolls with a boon at power level 1, normally at
power level 2, and with a bane at power level 3. A sleeping
person is very difficult to wake, but wakes up upon taking
damage. The spell can only be used on the living and has
no effect on monsters.

A [[Spell\|Spell]] in the school of [[Animism\|Animism]].
