The spell raises a wall from the ground or a stone floor –
one meter thick, two meters high, and three meters wide.
Each additional power level creates another section of the
same size. If someone is standing in that spot, the victim
must make an ACROBATICS roll (not an action) to avoid
falling off. If the wall is created under a low ceiling and the
roll fails, the victim takes 2D6 bludgeoning damage instead.

A Prerequisite for [[GNOME\|GNOME]].

A [[Spell\|Spell]] in the school of [[Elementalism\|Elementalism]].
