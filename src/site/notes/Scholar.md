### Flavor Text
Scholarly individuals gather knowledge about nature
and the shrouded history of the world. They seek the
truth in order to understand the unseen forces and deep
structures that hold the universe together as a single
entity. Some are specialists with specific areas of expertise,
such as monsters, plants, or dead languages. Others
pride themselves in avoiding limitations and dedicating
themselves to an all-encompassing, non-discriminatory
pursuit of knowledge where the mating calls of dragons,
the foaming of beer, and the inner workings of minerals
are all covered by the same academic system. Scholars
are often well-versed in myths, legends, and folklore, and
have learned to decipher ancient languages and forgotten
scripts.
