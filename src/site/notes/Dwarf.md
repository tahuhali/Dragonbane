Dwarves feel a strong connection with the bedrock and
the roots of the world. They are skilled blacksmiths and
artisans, admired for their ability to craft wondrous items
of precious metal, as well as of iron and stone. Dwarves
are also known as fierce warriors armed with axes, war
hammers, and other heavy melee weapons forged in their
underground smithies.

# Innate Ability: UNFORGIVING

You can activate this ability when attacking
someone who harmed you in the past (at least

It may be wise to write down the names of everyone
who harms you, so you do not forget them.
