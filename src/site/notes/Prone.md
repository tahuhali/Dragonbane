# Prone
A prone person or creature is laying on the ground. In combat, a target can be forced prone with the [[Toppling\|Topple]] action. While prone, you are more vulnerable to melee attacks and less vulnerable to ranged attacks (excluding AOE attacks).
- A melee attacks against a prone target gets a **boon to the attack** roll and an **extra D6 damage**.
- A Ranged attack against a prone target counts as an [[Obscured Target\|Obscured Target]] based on line of sight, having a bane to the roll in most circumstances.
- An attack that has an Area of Effect (AOE) such at the spell [[TIDAL WAVE\|TIDAL WAVE]] do not have a bane on a prone target. A prone target cannot dodge an AOE spell in most circumstances.

A prone character may use their action to dodge or parry an attack as normal. Attacking while prone is not effective and suffers a bane on the roll.

Both standing up and dropping to prone are a free action on your turn, but only one can be done. Eg. you cannot stand up, fire your bow, and then drop to the ground all in one turn.
