# Elf
A playable [[Kin\|Kin]]

### Flavor Text
Elves are an ancient kin that for eons have watched over
the forests of the world. They are guided by the stars
which they regard as divine beings capable of peering
into the deepest mysteries. Elven culture is meditatively
introverted and sometimes difficult for outsiders to
understand. However, it is clear that they are driven by
other, more metaphysical concerns than the lust for gold
and glory often found in dwarves and humans. Nonetheless,
their kin includes many powerful warriors, widely
respected and praised by the bards for their skill with
both sword and bow.
