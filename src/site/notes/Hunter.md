# Hunter
The hunter takes the traditional role of the Ranger, focusing on ranged weapons and survival skills, both of which are important to success. Their Heroic ability allows them to have a animal companion that is useful in and out of combat. Travel in Dragonbane requires planning, and a party without someone proficient in Bushcraft and Hunting & Fishing will find themselves lost and starving.

### ✦ Key Attribute: AGL
### ✦ Skills: 
Acrobatics, Awareness, Bows, Bushcraft, Hunting & Fishing, Knives, Slings, Sneaking
### ✦ Heroic Ability: Companion
✦ Requirement: Hunting & Fishing 12
✦ Willpower Points: 3
You can activate this ability to turn an animal (not a
monster) into your companion. This takes a stretch of time,
and you can only have one animal companion at a time.
The GM decides which animals are nearby – see the list on
page 99. The animal follows you as long as you remain
in its natural environment, and it can scout for you at no
additional WP cost. For 3 additional WP you can command
the animal to attack an enemy (free action for you).

### Flavor Text
Snaring hares, knifing boars, and silently stalking deer in
the depths of the forest with arrows on their bowstrings.
Hunters live for the hunt and the catch. Killing one’s prey
in a respectful manner and making use of all its parts – for
food, clothes, tools, and weapons – is a sacred calling for
all true hunters. Their home and destiny are in the wilds;
the magnificent, untamed, and cruel. That is where they
find peace of mind and gather their strength. That is where
their ruthless gods dwell. Many hunters are therefore quite
solitary and sometimes find it difficult to behave properly
among people.
