### Flavor Text
With a decent hammer, a trowel, and mortar, a skilled
artisan can astonish even the gods. They are proud
individuals, these tamers of nature and physical matter.
Whether they be builders, bricklayers, wainwrights,
blacksmiths, tanners, or coopers, the artisans are driven
by a solemn mission to bring order and structure out of
chaos. They construct bridges, houses, and fortifications,
forge weapons and tools, mold pots and jugs, make
barrels, and craft leather armor from tanned animal hides.
Every village needs capable artisans, and they are often
greatly respected for their practical and extremely useful
expertise.
