# Wolfkin
A playable [[Kin\|Kin]]

### Flavor Text
Wolfkin are the untamed fury of the wilds. They may
be highly intelligent creatures, and like the elves, they
have an unfailing tendency to sink into thought,
pondering the mysteries of the universe. But
simmering under the surface are ancient hunting
instincts and an unquenchable anger over past
wrongs committed against wolfkin, wolves, and the wilderness
in general. As hunters and pathfinders they are
second to none, but wolfkin can also be found as heavily
armed mercenaries, or mystics and healers in human
settlements.

# Innate Ability: HUNTING INSTINCTS
### âœ¦ Willpower Points: 3
You can use this ability to designate a creature
in sight, or a creature you can catch the scent of,
as your prey. This counts as an action in combat.
You can follow the scent of your prey for a full day,
and you can spend 1 further WP (not an action) to
gain a boon for an attack against your prey.
