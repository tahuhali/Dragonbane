✦ Range: 4 meters (sphere)
✦ Duration: Stretch
You drastically lower the temperature around you. All
natural fires in the area of effect are extinguished and all
living creatures lose D6 HP and D6 WP when the spell is
cast, and become cold as per the rules on page 54 – they
cannot heal HP or WP until they get warm.
Humanoids (not monsters) in the area of effect when
the spell is cast are also frozen in place and can neither
move nor perform actions (not even reactions). On each
turn, a frozen victim can make a STR roll (not an action)
to break free. Each additional power level increases the
range by 4 meters.
Any water in the area of effect immediately freezes. In
a river this creates an ice floe that you can walk on or use
as a raft.

A Prerequisite for [[TIDAL WAVE\|TIDAL WAVE]].

A [[Spell\|Spell]] in the school of [[Elementalism\|Elementalism]].
