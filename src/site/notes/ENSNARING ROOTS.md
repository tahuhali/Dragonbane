The victim is ensnared by roots and branches and is unable
to move. Breaking free requires an EVADE roll – with a
boon at power level 1, normally at power level 2, and with
a bane at power level 3. Each attempt counts as an action
in combat. Only one attempt is allowed per round, but
others can help. The spell *does not* work on monsters.

Upgraded to an AOE spell with [[ENGULFING FOREST\|ENGULFING FOREST]].

A [[Spell\|Spell]] in the school of [[Animism\|Animism]].
