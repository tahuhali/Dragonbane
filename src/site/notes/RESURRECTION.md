✦ Casting Time: Shift
✦ Range: Touch
✦ Duration: Permanent
You can channel nature’s forces to resurrect a dead person
– not as undead, but truly alive. This costs the mage one
point of WIL **permanently** (and reduces maximum WP
by one). The more time that has passed since the target
died, the more difficult it is. Within the same shift requires
power level 1, within a day requires power level 2, and
within a week requires power level 3. If over a week has
passed, the body is too decomposed to be RESURRECTED.
*Only one* attempt can be made – if it fails, the victim is
permanently dead. A person brought back to life loses D3
skill levels in all CHA-based skills (to a minimum of 3).
