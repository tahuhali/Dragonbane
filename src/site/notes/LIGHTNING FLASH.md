You call down a flash of lightning from the sky. If the spell is
cast successfully, the target takes **2D6 damage**. The lightning
flash continues to another __random__ target within 2 meters of
the target, inflicting **2D4 damage**. Each power level beyond
the first increases the number of dice rolled for damage by
one (e.g., 3D6 and 3D4 respectively at power level 2). Metal
armor has no effect but the spell can be dodged or parried
as a ranged attack, and if this is successfully done, no further
target is hit. Indoors, the WP cost to cast the spell is **doubled**.
