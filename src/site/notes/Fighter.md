# Fighter
Fighters are retired bodyguards, mercenaries, or soldiers. They aren't skilled in much besides fighting, but they sure are handy when you need them. In Dragonbane, a fighters advantage come from their flexibility. Weapons in Dragonbane have subtle but important differences, having the right tool for the job can make all the difference. Since you can have up to 3 weapons "at hand" the fighter will rarely find themselves without a good option in combat. Their heroic ability lets them have unique control over *when* they take their turn.

### Flavor Text
Fighters earn their living by following the way of the sword.
It may of course also be the way of the spear or crossbow,
but a fighter’s specialty is always weapon proficiency and
violence. But this is not to say that all fighters are driven
by bloodlust. For some it is a matter of professional pride
to achieve the maximum effect with minimal bloodshed;
others are lazy and prefer saber-rattling to actual combat.
Many fighters are troubled souls, haunted by nightmares
and bad memories of a life spent in the company of death.
They can therefore be surprisingly sentimental, prone to
tears and compassionate embraces.
