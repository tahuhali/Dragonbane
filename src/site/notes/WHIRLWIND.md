✦ Requirement: Word, gesture
✦ Casting Time: Action
✦ Range: 4 meters (sphere)
✦ Duration: Instant
The spell creates a mighty whirlwind around the mage. All
untethered objects and creatures up to human size in the
area of effect are hurled 2D4 meters away, suffer the same
amount of bludgeoning damage, and land prone. Each
additional power level increases the range by 4 meters and
inflicts another D4 damage.
If you take a bane on the roll, you can let one person in
range be hurled to another spot of your choice within the
spell’s range. You decide whether that person takes damage
and whether they land prone.

A Prerequisite for [[FIRESTORM\|FIRESTORM]] and [[SYLPH\|SYLPH]].

A [[Spell\|Spell]] in the school of [[Elementalism\|Elementalism]].
