The spell sends a fireball from your hand or focus at the
target. The fireball can be dodged or parried as a ranged
attack. The fireball inflicts 2D6 damage on a hit and sets
fire to flammable objects. Each power level beyond the first
increases the damage by D6 or creates another fireball that
hits another target within range.
