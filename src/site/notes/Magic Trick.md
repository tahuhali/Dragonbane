Magic tricks succeed automatically and always cost 1 WP.

So-called magic tricks are minor, relatively harmless spells.
They are often the first thing a mage learns, as these simple
spells train their minds to handle magical power. Each
school has its own magic tricks. The limit on prepared
spells (above) does not apply to magic tricks. Your magic
tricks are always prepared. All magic tricks require a gesture
(below) to be cast.

Gesture: The spell is activated by making specific
hand movements.

Magic tricks are easier to learn than real
spells. It takes one stretch to learn a new trick from a teacher
or grimoire. No advancement mark or roll is required.
