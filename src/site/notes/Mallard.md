# Mallard (You're a duck)
A playable [[Kin \|Kin ]]

### Flavor text
The origin of the mallards is shrouded in mystery. Some
scholars claim that they came from a mighty island realm
that was swallowed by the sea thousands of years ago;
others believe them to be the result of a failed magical
experiment. Whatever the truth may be, these feathered
humanoids are a common sight in the world. They have
a knack for trade, and their agitated quacking is often
an integral part of the soundscape around marketplaces
and trade caravans. However, some mallards seek their
fortunes as brigands, pirates, or mercenaries. Despite their
diminutive size, they are fierce in battle and feared by
many for their murderous rage.

# Innate Ability: ILL-TEMPERED

cannot be used for rolls against INT or INTbased
skills.

# Innate Ability: WEBBED FEET
### ✦ Willpower Points: —
As a mallard you also get a boon to all SWIMMING
rolls. You always move at full speed in or
under water.
