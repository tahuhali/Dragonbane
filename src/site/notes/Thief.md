# Thief
Similar to a traditional rouge, the Thief is the best at acquiring things that do not belong to them, be the owner living or dead. The Backstabbing ability is powerful in combat when used tactically, able to one-shot weaker enemies and finish off bigger ones. Most situations benefit from having a Thief around, as long as their reputation doesn't complicate things.

### ✦ Key Attribute: AGL
### ✦ Skills: 
Acrobatics, Awareness, Bluffing, Evade, Knives, Sleight of Hand, Sneaking, Spot Hidden
### ✦ Heroic Ability: Backstabbing
✦ Requirement: Knives 12
✦ Willpower Points: 3
You can activate this ability when making a melee attack
against an enemy that is also within 2 meters of another
player character. Your attack then counts as a sneak attack,
which means it cannot be dodged or parried, you get a
boon to the roll, and the number of dice rolled for the
damage is increased by one (i.e. 2D8 instead of D8). This
ability can only be used with a *subtle* weapon (page 74).
Activating this ability does not count as an action.

### Flavor Text
Thieves see themselves as professional experts specialized
in the acquisition of other people’s property. It is a proud
and surprisingly principled profession. They like to
refer to solemn principles of honor and honesty among
thieves – something that is often hard to take seriously for
theft victims and other outsiders. Many thieves organize
themselves into guilds; others take pride in working independently
and walk alone through the night and the shadows.
Some are discreet specialists whose only method is
guile, but the thief profession also includes brutal brigands
who do not hesitate to use weapons to achieve their ends.
