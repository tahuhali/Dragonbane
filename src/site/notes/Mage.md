# Mage
Mage is the only profession that gets immediate access to magic and chooses what is essentially a "subclass" in their magic school. Both Mages and other profession can learn additional schools of magic through the MAGIC TALENT Heroic Ability. Be a Mage if you like complexity, depth, and reading lists of spells. The Mage has many [[Homebrew\|Homebrew]] rules I use to make it more approachable.
A [[profession\|profession]] you can choose as part of [[Steps to make a Character\|Steps to make a Character]].

### Flavor Text:
Mages have learned to control the ancient forces that
permeate nature and the primordial structures of the
world. It is not a uniform profession, but includes
a motley crew of individualists and headstrong
eccentrics. There are several schools of magic with
different views of what magic is and how it works.
In the core game you can choose between Animism,
Elementalism, and Mentalism. Animists
believe that everything in the world has a
spiritual presence and see magic as a power
lent by nature’s spirits. Elementalists describe
magic in terms of four elements that constitute
the essence of all things. Mentalists say that
magic comes from within, and that it can be
manifested through self-control and discipline.
