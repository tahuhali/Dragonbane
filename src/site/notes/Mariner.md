# Mariner
The Mariner is an explorer with focus on exploration. The skills of such an explorer are useful many other places than just the ocean. Their natural affinity to water works just as well when crossing a river or exploring underground lakes. If you add Bushcraft to their trained skills, this profession could be the key leader anytime the group seeks to conquer the unknown.

### Flavor Text
Foaming waves and ships sailing fearlessly through dark
waters are the domain and calling of the mariner. Some
seafarers are forever sworn to the high seas; others stick to
rivers and lakes. But all of them have one thing in common:
a symbiotic relationship with the element of water – often a
specific lake, river, or bay. This relationship is always complicated,
based on love, respect, and mortal dread in equal
measure. Otherwise, the seafaring profession is wide and
varied, covering everything from coastal pirates, privateers,
and surly ferrymen to whalers, explorers, and authoritative
captains of maritime trade expeditions.
