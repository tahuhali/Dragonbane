You call upon the spirits of the forest who quickly make
thickets of thorns and roots shoot up from the ground in
the area of effect. The area counts as [[rough terrain\|rough terrain]] (page
44), and everyone except yourself (*not monsters*) who is
in the area of effect when you cast the spell is ensnared by
roots and branches, unable to move. Breaking free requires
an EVADE roll – with a boon at power level 1, normally at
power level 2, and with a bane at power level 3. Each attempt
counts as an action in combat. Only one attempt is allowed
per round. Other people who are not ensnared can help.
