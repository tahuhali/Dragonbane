# Knight
Knights are defenders, both physically and socially. They benefit from both a high STR and CHA attribute. Knight are the only class with the option to start with full plate armor and an ability to get lots of use out of it. In Dragonbane, Armor acts as damage reduction and can even break enemy weapons. Be prepared to deal the drawbacks of armor, especially the banes they put on skills.

You do not hesitate to take a hit to protect your friends. If
you and another player character are both within 2 meters
of the same enemy and the enemy tries to attack the other
character, you can activate this ability to force the enemy
to attack you instead. Using this ability can be done out of
turn and it does not count as an action.

### Flavor Text
Knights are warriors who have sworn fealty to a higher
power, such as an order of knights, a liege lord, or a god.
This oath of fealty lies at the heart of their worldview and
existence. It always includes rules and principles the knight
must obey in thought and deed. Demands for chivalry
and a noble mind are often combined with an implacable
hatred for anything deemed contrary to the spirit of the
oath. Many knights are part of an order, but there are also
lone knights who have devoted their lives to defending
something specific – perhaps a person or a place – that
gives their lives a higher purpose.
