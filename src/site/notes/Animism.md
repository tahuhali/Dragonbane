### Flavor Text
The world is alive. It is full of spirits and gods, and all
things have a soul. Like nature itself, spirits and gods
are neither good nor evil. They may not be omnipotent,
but they possess great power and should be treated with
respect. If you speak to them in the right way, they may
lend power to your animist magic.
