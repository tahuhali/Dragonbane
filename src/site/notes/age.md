# Age
Choosing your age is part of [[Steps to make a Character\|Steps to make a Character]].

Your age in Dragonbane has a significant impact on play. It can modify your [[attributes\|attributes]] and determines how many [[Skills\|skills]] start "trained".
Many adventurers leave their village at a young age, but sometimes older individuals are forced out to hunt for treasure among the ruins. Age is divided into three categories: young, adult, and old. You choose your age freely or let the die decide. Older age means that you start the game with lower attributes but higher skill ratings â€“ see the table below. Modifications to the attributes below do not stack.

| D6  | AGE   | Trained Skills$^1$ | Attributes$^2$                  |
| --- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1-3 | Young | 6+2                | AGL & CON +1                    |
| 4-5 | Adult | 6+4                | -                               |
| 6   | Old   | 6+6                | STR, AGL & CON -2, INT & WIL +1 |
**Note 1**: Six trained skills must be selected from your profession, the rest may be chosen freely.
**Note 2**: Attributes may never be higher than 18 or lower than 1.

Most rolls in Dragonbane are done with skills, not attributes. Some example exceptions would be Death rolls (CON) and resisting fear (WIL). However, modifiers to your attributes from your age impacts the base chance for all skills governed by that attribute.
As described in the [[Skills\|skills]] section, after your character is made, there is no way to make a skill "trained" thus doubling it. At the end of each gaming Session, you can improve skills one point at a time via [[Advancement\|Advancement]].


Your age measured in *years* depends on your [[Kin\|kin]] and has no mechanical significance. Young, Adult and Old are relative to your Kin
