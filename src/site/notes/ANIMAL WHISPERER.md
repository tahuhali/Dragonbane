**This spell lets you talk to a bird or mammal.** You can ask
a number of questions equal to the power level. Animals
can tell you what they have seen, heard, or smelled – but
they do not perceive the world as humanoids do, and their
answers are hard to interpret. The main advantage is that
they **never lie**.
