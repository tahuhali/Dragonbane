# Skills
Skills are not extra things you can do, Skills are the primary mechanic for resolving uncertainty. Most dices rolls in Dragonbane, including attack rolls, are done with your skills. Dragonbane uses the "Roll Under" dice system, where you roll a d20 and a result equal to or lower than your skill counts as a success. Likewise, rolling a 1 is a critical success and a 20 in a critical failure.
Skills represent knowledge and abilities you have acquired during (or prior to) your life as an adventurer. They are important, as they determine how effectively you can perform certain actions in the game. There are thirty core skills in the base game, and are measured by skill level on a scale from 1 to 18. The higher, the better.
### Base Chance
Every skill is connected to an attribute, which determines your base chance in that skill. See [[attributes\|attributes]] for a breakdown. This is also indicated on the character sheet. The base chance is a “free” skill level that you get automatically. See the table below:

| Attribute | Base Chance |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1-5       | 3           |
| 6-8       | 4           |
| 9-12      | 5           |
| 13-15     | 6           |
| 16-18     | 7           |
### Starting Skill Levels 
In addition to the base chances, you start out with a number of trained skills – eight, ten, or twelve depending on your age. At the start of the game, your level in a trained skills is equal to **twice the base chance**. *Six* of your trained skills must be selected from those listed by your [[profession\|profession]]. The rest (two, four, or six depending on your [[age\|age]]) are chosen freely. You can increase your skill levels during the game.

**Please Note**: You choose your trained skills as a part of [[Steps to make a Character\|Steps to make a Character]]. After your character is made, there is no way to make a skill "trained" thus doubling it. At the end of each gaming Session, you can improve skills one point at a time via [[Advancement\|Advancement]]. 

### Secondary Skills
Beyond the core skills there are secondary skills, such as the schools of magic. In this base game, you don’t get a base chance in any secondary skills, but future expansions and supplements may modify this.
