# Merchant
Merchants are all about treasure, removing things that would be in their way, and maximizing the gain from adventures. They can be built similar to a CHA based rouge, a good "face" of the party and dangerous in a sneak attacks. The extra gold you'll have with a merchant makes affording better gear and training easier. Upgrading this profession to be able to cast Mentalism spells can be quite potent.
A [[profession\|profession]] you can choose as part of [[Steps to make a Character\|Steps to make a Character]].

### Flavor Text
Buying cheap and selling dear is the golden rule of
merchants. No commodity is too commonplace, no deal
too small or insignificant. Inside every piece of copper is
a future gold coin, and inside every creature – living or
undead – is a customer with needs and dreams of luxury.
The only thing more important than the customer’s wishes
is the sweet clatter of gold and silver pouring into the
coffers. Some merchants run permanent shops in towns,
villages, and other settlements. Others travel with trade
caravans and adventuring companies in constant search
of exotic luxury goods, new customers, and marketable
artifacts.
