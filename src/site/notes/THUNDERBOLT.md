You call down a mighty thunderstroke on a target, who
suffers 2D10 damage. The thunderstroke continues to up
to three random targets within 2 meters of each other. The
damage is 2D8 for the second target, 2D6 for the third,
and 2D4 for the fourth. Each power level beyond the first
increases the number of dice rolled for damage by one.
Metal armor has no effect but the spell can be dodged or
parried as a ranged attack, and if this is successfully done,
no further target is hit. Indoors, the WP cost to cast the
spell is doubled.
