# Profession
Your profession is what your character did before they started their adventure. It's the equivalent to "Class" in D&D. Your profession determines your Skills, Heroic Ability, and starting gear. Each Profession has a "Key Attribute" That most of the skills and abilities are designed to complement.
Your profession is *not* a set track that determines how you progress, it's your characters starting point. As you play you will be able to improve any of your skills, gain new heroic abilities, and obtain new gear. 

**Important note**: The [[Skills\|skills]] in each profession are available as starting *options*, you can, but are not required to be trained in all of them. As described in the [[Skills\|Skills]] section, the number of skills you start trained in is determined by your age. Only the **first six skills** you choose must be from your *profession*, so choose a profession where you see multiple skills you'd enjoy using.
