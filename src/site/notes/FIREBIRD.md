The spell sends a terrifying bird of fire from your hand or
focus at the target. The attack can be dodged or parried
as a ranged attack. The firebird inflicts 2D10 damage on
a hit and sets fire to flammable objects. Each power level
beyond the first increases the damage by D10 or creates
another firebird that hits another target in range.
