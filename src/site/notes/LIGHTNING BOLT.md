✦ Range: 40 meters
✦ Duration: Instant
You call down a great bolt of lightning on a target, who
suffers 2D8 damage. The bolt continues to another random
target within 2 meters of the target, inflicting 2D6 damage,
and then to a third target within 2 meters, who suffers 2D4
damage. Each power level beyond the first increases the
number of dice rolled for damage by one. Metal armor has
no effect but the spell can be dodged or parried as a ranged
attack, and if this is successfully done, no further target is
hit. Indoors, the WP cost to cast the spell is doubled.
