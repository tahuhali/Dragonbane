# Human

A Playable [[Kin\|Kin]]
### Flavor Text
Humans are the last-born. The other kin have songs and
legends about times before the dawn of humanity. Today
the humans have spread across much of the known world.
Many are peasants living in little villages clustered around
castles and palaces. Others are warriors sworn to protect
the peasants and their vulnerable settlements, markets,
and trade caravans from the dangers of the world. Still
more are adventurers: fearless humans who venture into
the unknown in search of glory, gold, and knowledge.

# Innate Ability: ADAPTIVE
### âœ¦ Willpower Points: 3
When rolling for a skill, you can **choose to make
the roll using another skill of your choice.** You
must be able to justify how you use the selected
skill instead of the normal one. The GM has the
final word, but should be lenient.
