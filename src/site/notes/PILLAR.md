The spell raises a pillar, three meters high and one meter
wide, from the ground or a stone floor. If someone is standing
in that spot, the victim must make an ACROBATICS roll
(not an action) to avoid falling off the pillar. If the pillar is
created under a low ceiling and the roll fails, the victim takes
2D6 bludgeoning damage instead. For each additional power
level, the height of the pillar increases by three meters, which
can mean falling damage to anyone who falls off (page 53).
This would mean 1D6 damage per power level of the spell if the target falls, unless the target succeeds at their acrobatics roll.
### FALLING
Falling on a hard surface inflicts a number of D6s of
bludgeoning damage equal to half of the height of the fall
in meters, rounded down. A fall of less than two meters
inflicts no damage. A successful ACROBATICS roll
reduces the number of D6 by half (rounded up). Armor
does not protect against falling damage.

A Prerequisite for [[STONE SHIELD\|STONE SHIELD]] and [[STONEWALL\|STONEWALL]].
