# Toppling
This is a [[Weapon Attributes\|Weapon Attribute]] for [[Melee Weapons\|Melee Weapons]]

A weapon with the attribute grants a boon when trying to [[Trip\|Trip]] and opponent. Tripping is an action that when successful makes the target [[Prone\|Prone]] (laying on the ground). Attacks against a prone target have a boon (advantage on the roll) and gain an extra D6 damage. While standing up is a free action, tripping can be a essential teamwork strategy when attempting to dispose of difficult targets. Armored targets with a bane to Evade are much easier to trip.

### Topple Action Details
You try to topple and enemy to the ground instead of inflicting damage. This is handled with an [[opposed roll\|opposed roll]] between your skill level in the weapon you are using and the enemy's [[Evade\|Evade]] skill. If your weapon has the toppling feature, you get a boon. The attack counts as an action for you, but not for your opponent. It *cannot* be dodged or parried.
An effective way of using this special attack is to work together with another person. If you topple the opponent, your friend can attack the  prone enemy before they get up.

### Monsters
A player character can try to topple a monster, rolling against a default Evade skill of 15 for all monsters. If the monster has four legs or more, the attackers gets a Bane on the roll. The GM may determine that certain massive enemies cannot be toppled in most circumstances.
