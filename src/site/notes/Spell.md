# Casting Spells

To cast a spell you must spend Willpower Points (WP)
and roll against your skill level in the relevant school.
Any school can be used to cast general spells. If the roll
succeeds, the spell has the intended effect, as per its
description. Otherwise, it has no effect. You can push the
roll if this optional rule is used. [[Magic Trick\|Magic trick]]s succeed automatically
and always cost 1 WP.
#### Zero WP:
Some spells can drain WP from another person.
Hitting zero WP has no other effect than prohibiting the
use of abilities that require WP.
### Casting Time
Unless otherwise stated, casting a spell **always counts as an
action in combat.** However, there are reaction spells which
are performed outside your own turn. Unlike other reactions
in combat, such as parrying and dodging, reaction
spells do not replace your regular action in the round. This
means that you can cast as many of them as you want, if
you have enough WP. There are also rituals, which take a
stretch of time or even a shift to perform.
### RANGE
Each spell has a maximum range. Unlike ranged weapons,
spells cannot be used on targets outside their specified
range. Personal range means that the spell only affects the
person casting it.
#### Area of Effect: 
Some spells affect an entire area. That area
is called the area of effect. Unless stated otherwise, the area
of effect always starts at the mage casting the spell.
Area of effect spells can be dodged but not parried,
unless stated otherwise. You can exempt one or more
targets within the area from the spell’s effects, but you then
get a bane on the roll.
#### Sphere: 
If the range is described as sphere, the spell affects
all targets within the chosen area except the mage themself.

#### Cone:
If the range is described as cone, the spell affects
all targets within a cone-shaped area whose width at any
given point equals the distance from the source of the spell.
The range indicates the length of the cone.

### DURATION
Each spell specifies the duration of its effect.
✦ Instant: The effect occurs instantly and has no lasting
effect.
✦ Round: The effect lasts until your turn in the
next round.
✦ Stretch: The effect lasts for one stretch of time.
✦ Shift: The effect lasts until the end of the current shift.
✦ Concentration: The effect ceases if you perform
another action, take damage, or fail a WIL roll for
resisting fear. If you are interrupted by a sudden disturbance,
such as a sound, you must make a WIL roll (not
an action) to maintain your concentration.

### FAILURE, DRAGONS AND DEMONS
If the roll for casting a spell fails, the spell has no effect,
but you still spend your WP. You are free to describe how
the failure manifests itself in the story, as long as it has no
mechanical effect.
**Rolling a Dragon**: Rolling a Dragon when you cast a spell
means that your target must roll a dragon to resist, parry,
or dodge the spell, and that you may choose one of the
following effects:
✦ The damage or range of the spell is doubled.
✦ The spell does not cost any WP.
✦ You can immediately cast another spell, but get a bane
on the roll.
**Rolling a Demon**: If you roll a Demon, you cannot push
the roll. There is also a risk of something going terribly
wrong – see the optional rule for [[magical mishaps\|magical mishaps]] below.

### POWER LEVEL
The power level of a spell indicates how much power you
charge it with. The power level ranges from 1 to 3. Casting
a spell costs 2 WP per power level. In other words, normal
spells always cost at least 2 WP, and magic tricks always
cost 1 WP. Some spells do not use power level – these
always cost 2 WP.

### Power from the Body:
If you have just one or zero WP
left, you can draw power from your body if need be. But
this is harmful, potentially even lethal. Roll a die of your
choice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, or D20) before casting the
spell – the result indicates how many WP you gain and
must use straight away, but you also take the same amount
of damage. WP not used immediately are lost. The damage
is applied after the spell is cast. *Power from the body cannot
be used for healing spells.*

### REQUIREMENTS
To cast a spell, you must fulfill one or more requirements
which are specified in the description of each spell.
✦ **Word:** The spell is activated with a chant or power
word. It cannot be a whisper.
✦ **Gesture**: The spell is activated by making specific
hand movements.
✦ **Focus**: The spell is activated with an item held in your
hand, such as a wand, crystal ball, or amulet.
✦ **Ingredient**: The spell is activated using a certain
ingredient, which is consumed in the process.
Some spells have multiple requirements. You cannot cast a
spell unless all its requirements are fulfilled.
### Rank
Spells are divided into ranks. These have no mechanical
effect, but indicate how complex and powerful spells are.
As a mage you start the game with only rank 1 spells, but
you can learn higher rank spells during the game.


### MAGIC AND METAL
Metal has an anti-magical effect, which means that you
cannot use magic if you are wearing metal armor or
have a metal weapon at hand (page 45). This includes
partially metal items such as axes, spears, studded leather,
and arrows (but not staves, clubs, or slings). Items in your
inventory do not count.
### PREPARED SPELLS
Spells are complicated, and the maximum number of spells
you can hold prepared in your memory at the same time
is equal to your base chance for INT (page 25). When
you have reached your limit and want to prepare another
spell, you need to replace a spell. To prepare spells, you
need to study them in a grimoire. This takes a shift of time,
regardless of the number of spells. It can be done during a
shift rest (page 52). You can only prepare spells that you
have learned (page 61). Mark your prepared spells with
an X on your character sheet.

### GRIMOIRE
Most mages have a grimoire, and newly created mages
automatically get one. In the grimoire, you record all the
spells you know. Recording one spell takes a shift of time.
You can record unreadied spells.
Once you have learned more spells than can be held
prepared, your grimoire becomes crucial. In an emergency,
you can cast spells directly from the grimoire, but it takes
twice as long as normal (see below).
Grimoires from other mages are also an effective way
to learn new spells, should you not have a teacher. Read
more about learning new magic on page 61.
#### Lost Grimoire
If you lose your grimoire, you cannot
prepare the spells you kept in it. To be able to use the
unprepared spells again, you first need to get a new grimoire
and record these spells in it.

# NEWLY CREATED MAGE
As a newly created mage you may select three
rank 1 spells and three [[Magic Trick\|Magic Trick]]s to start the
game with. They must be chosen from your
school of magic or general magic. You also get a
grimoire where all your spells are recorded.
