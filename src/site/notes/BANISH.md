**Demons and undead** rising from their graves are a violation
of the natural order and must be stopped. This spell
inflicts **2D8 damage** on such a being. Each additional
power level increases the damage by **D8**. Armor and
natural armor have no effect, and the spell cannot be
dodged or parried.
