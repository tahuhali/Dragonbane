# Attributes

Your adventurer has six base attributes that indicate your
basic physical and mental capabilities, on a scale from 3 to 18. The higher the score, the better.
Determining your base attributes is part of [[Steps to make a Character\|Steps to make a Character]].
## Starting Scores
#### Official Method
I recommend this method first. Roll 4D6 and remove the worst die, which gives you a score between 3 and 18. Assign that score to an attribute of your choice. Repeat this process five more times until you have assigned a score to each attribute. You must assign each score as you roll them, but once done you may swap two scores. Then you adjust your attributes based on your age. Note that you can never have more than 18 in an attribute, regardless of your age. Once assigned, your attributes rarely change during the game.

**Please note**: If your are unsatisfied with the number your got, you may completely start over. However after a few tries you are still unsatisfied, consider using a Standard array.
#### Standard Array
Instead of rolling for your attributes, you may choose a standard array and assign the numbers where you want. I only recommend this for someone who already tried rolling their stats as above.
- **Focused**: 18, 16, 14, 11, 9, 8
- **Balanced**: 16, 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, 8
- **Diverse**: 15, 14, 13, 13, 13, 8, 5
