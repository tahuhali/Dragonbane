# Halfling
A playable [[Kin\|Kin]]

### Flavor Text
Halflings are short humanoids often found in hilly
farmlands where they live in earthen dwellings with well stocked
larders. They are modest and amiable by nature,
with a natural affinity for hearth and home. Halflings
are neither warlike nor ambitious, but highly drawn to
epic tales and beautiful songs from days long gone. From
time to time, this desire can lead them to leave the safety
of their homes in search of grand adventures. Because
of their vulnerability and fear of “the tall ones,” they are
good at staying hidden and quickly getting out of critical
situations.
