# Bard
Bard's are extremely valuable allies. They are a great "face" of the party with their key attribute of CHA. Combat in Dragonbane is very dangerous, a skilled bard can help keep your out of combat, use persuasion to rally fallen allies, and the musician ability can dramatically change the battlefield if used wisely. Just make sure you choose the right instrument!

### Flavor Text
The memory of ancient deeds and riches is kept alive by
the bards. They are singers, musicians, and entertainers.
Many travel between inns and marketplaces where they
earn their keep through the telling of ballads and fairy
tales; others perform at princely courts, reciting glorious
poems of dragons and heroic kings. Many bards see themselves
as chroniclers responsible for preserving contemporary
deeds in the memory of future generations. They are
always on the lookout for people and achievements worthy
of being immortalized in epic verse, and any bard worth
their salt is always working on at least a few masterpieces
of song, music, or poetry.
